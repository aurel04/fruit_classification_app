# üçì Fruit Classification System
This project is a fruit image classification web app built using Streamlit and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It supports two hybrid model configurations trained on different datasets (Ubaya-IFDS3000 and Ubaya-IFDS5000).

## üîç Overview
This system allows user to upload an image which then will be categorized into different fruit type by the system.

## üß∞ Techs in use
- **Model 1**: Hybrid CNN VGG16 + ResNet50V2 (trained on 3000 images)
- **Model 2**: Hybrid CNN ResNet50V2 + InceptionV3 (trained on 5000 images)
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Progamming Language**: python
